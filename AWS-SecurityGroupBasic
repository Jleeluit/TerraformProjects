AWS Provider
Use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) provider to interact with the many resources supported by AWS. You must configure the provider with the proper credentials before you can use it.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

To learn the basics of Terraform using this provider, follow the hands-on get started tutorials. Interact with AWS services, including Lambda, RDS, and IAM by following the AWS services tutorials.

Example Usage
Terraform 0.13 and later:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
Terraform 0.12 and earlier:

# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 4.0"
  region  = "us-east-1"
}
